# What

This is a starter template for Front-End related projects. It contains a handful of modules and tasks to help you build quickly. Use it for a React or AngularJS project or when you just want to mess around. It includes a dev server (browsersync) as well as all the build tools you'll need to get started. ES6 and JSX Transpiling are built in... so just start building.

Enjoy.

## Usage

- Clone this repo
- `rm -rf .git` to remove my .git folder
- `git init` to reinitialize your own git project
- Build something cool


## Scripts

- `gulp start`: This is the primary task that will fire up the server and allow you to start building
- `npm run deploy`: This will deploy your application to Surge.sh for you
